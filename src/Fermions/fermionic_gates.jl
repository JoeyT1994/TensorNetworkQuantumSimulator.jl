# Pre-built fermionic gate constructors for Trotterised dynamics.
#
# A gate is a parity-even operator tensor in the locally-ordered formalism
# (arXiv:2410.02215). Its legs are the usual operator legs: for each site a primed
# OUT leg `u = prime(s)` and an unprimed IN leg `s`, with arrows `out` (false) on the
# `u`s and `in` (true) on the `s`s — exactly the layout of `even_op_tensor`/`odd_op_tensor`.
#
# Construction principle (derived, not fitted):
#   * The correct locally-ordered single-tensor array of ANY physical operator equals
#     that operator's matrix elements ⟨out|O|in⟩ in a fixed mode ordering. This is true
#     by construction here because every Hamiltonian below is assembled out of the
#     already-validated single-site primitives (`even_op_tensor`, and `odd_op_tensor`
#     pairs joined over the operator-string dummy bond by `contract`), whose arrays were
#     checked to reproduce the Fock matrix elements.
#   * Physical operator multiplication is ordinary matrix multiplication in that basis
#     (e.g. for hopping, H² = n_i + n_j − 2 n_i n_j, whose matrix is the plain matmul
#     H·H). Therefore exp(coeff·dt·H) is the ordinary dense matrix exponential of the
#     Hamiltonian's Fock matrix, re-wrapped with the Hamiltonian's own leg metadata.
#
# NOTE: fermionic `contract` of two multi-site OPERATOR tensors is *network*
# contraction, not operator composition — closing several operator legs at once injects
# extra supertrace signs. So gates must be exponentiated as matrices here (not by
# composing tensors).
#
# APPLYING a gate to a state: the gate's dense array is an even operator with its sites
# ADJACENT in a fixed mode order, so it acts as `o ⊗ I` on every other leg. Apply it by
# (1) bringing the state's physical legs for the gate's sites adjacent via a fermionic
# `permute` (this threads the correct Koszul sign through any leg — e.g. a QR/virtual
# bond — sitting between them), then (2) contracting the gate onto those adjacent legs
# with an ORDINARY (non-fermionic) contraction. See `simple_update`. A fermionic
# `contract` blob (`o * ψ`) instead injects spurious supertrace signs and is wrong;
# ordinary contraction WITHOUT the adjacency permute misses the reorder sign. Either
# error corrupts the gate's odd-odd (e.g. hopping) channel whenever a fermionic bond
# lies between the two sites.

default `t = 1` is the real symmetric hopping; a complex `t = |t|·e^{iφ}` is a Peierls phase.

conjugates — equivalently, swapping `s_i ↔ s_j` conjugates `t`, so orient every bond
consistently to realise the flux pattern you want (the phases around a plaquette must sum to
its enclosed flux).
