# Finite CTMRG with CVM regions — design and current state

## Goal

A genuine **finite, position-resolved CTMRG**: a 4C+4T environment on *every vertex*, grown
and projected by local corner moves, with the free energy taken from the region-graph (CVM)
functional

```
F  =  Σ_v ln Z_v   −   Σ_e ln Z_e   +   Σ_p ln Z_p            (Möbius numbers +1 / −1 / +1)

Z_v : vertex ring     = 4C + 4T + a        (parent region)
Z_e : edge strip      = 4C + 2T            (edge overlap)
Z_p : plaquette loop  = 4C                 (corner overlap)
```

made stationary. This is **not** boundary MPS and is intended to supersede it: the regions are
local per-vertex objects, there is no planarity requirement, and the corner tier is
information that BP and boundary MPS do not carry.

Exactness check: for a disk, `V − E + P = 1` (on `L×L`: `L² − 2L(L−1) + (L−1)² = 1`), so when
every region contracts to the exact `Z` the weighted sum returns `ln Z`. At finite `χ` the
region errors cancel to a large degree — that cancellation is the point of the method
(measured earlier: per-region ~1e-5 collapsing to ~1e-9 in the sum).

## What is WRONG with the current committed engine

`src/MessagePassing/ctmenvironmentcache.jl` (commits `97f4092`, `9542756`) absorbs the lattice
**row by row** and exposes **row** environments. That is a boundary-MPS-shaped contraction, not
per-vertex CTMRG. It is accurate and useful as a contractor, but it is the wrong object:

* environments are rows, not per-vertex 4C+4T rings;
* there are no corner tensors at all, so no CVM regions and no `Σ_v/Σ_e/Σ_p` sum;
* a "region" carved out of it cannot differ between vertices — splitting a fixed chain at
  different columns returns the same scalar, so the Möbius sum degenerates to `(V−E+P)·ln Z`.

Genuine regions require each corner to be an **independently truncated, few-leg object**,
closing into a small ring (~χ⁴), *not* a slice of a whole-lattice contraction.

The per-vertex DP that does this **was built and validated, then deleted**. Recover it from
git rather than rewriting:

```
git show 97f4092:examples/ctm_cvm_stationary.jl
```

Everything it reported numerically is **superseded** — it used the one-sided projector that we
later proved defective.

## Target design

### Objects (all position-resolved)

```
C_NW[x,y] = block of all vertices with col<x, row<y        (and NE / SW / SE)
T_N[x,y]  = column x, rows<y     T_S[x,y] = column x, rows≥y
T_W[x,y]  = cols<x, row y        T_E[x,y] = cols≥x, row y
```

### Interface projector families (nested chains, each derived exactly once)

```
PH_N[x,y] : {hb[(x,j)] : j < y}    nested in y     shared by C_NW.right, C_NE.left, T_N.left/right
PH_S[x,y] : {hb[(x,j)] : j ≥ y}    nested down     shared by C_SW.right, C_SE.left, T_S.left/right
PV_W[x,y] : {vb[(i,y)] : i < x}    nested in x     shared by C_NW.down, C_SW.up, T_W.up/down
PV_E[x,y] : {vb[(i,y)] : i ≥ x}    nested down     shared by C_NE.down, C_SE.up, T_E.up/down
```

Each interface is shared by several blocks, so its projector **must be a single object** —
deriving it twice from different sides yields inconsistent bases and silently corrupts the
contraction. Assign one deriving corner per family (NW derives PH_N and PV_W; SE derives PH_S
and PV_E; NE and SW consume).

### The move — grow, then project

Corner growth absorbs the two adjoining edge tensors and the vertex tensor (this is the local
CTMRG move; it is what the collaborator specified):

```
C̃_NW(x+1,y+1) = C_NW(x,y) · T_N(x,y) · T_W(x,y) · a(x,y)
```

Its two open interfaces are exactly `PH_N[x,y+1]` (right) and `PV_W[x+1,y]` (down), each a
nested extension of the previous level. Eigendecompose to get the projectors, then

```
C_NW(x+1,y+1) = C̃ · P_right · P_down
```

Edges grow analogously: `T_N(x,y+1) = T_N(x,y)·a(x,y)`, projected on both sides.

### Projector: two-sided, from a Hermitian eigendecomposition (no SVD)

With `ρ_L = A†A` and `ρ_R = B†B` for the two half-environments of an interface, `H = B ρ_L Bᵀ`
is Hermitian PSD with eigenvalues `S²` and eigenvectors `V`:

```
P_A = Bᵀ V S^(-1/2)          P_B = S^(-3/2) Vᵀ B ρ_L
```

`A (P_A P_B) Bᵀ = A Bᵀ` exactly at full rank. Both come from **one** eigenbasis — using two
separate decompositions for `U` and `V` invites per-vector sign/phase mismatch and arbitrary
rotation inside degenerate clusters, and double-layer corners *do* have degeneracies
(`λ_ij = λ_ji` under ket↔bra exchange).

Hard-won numerical points (all measured, see `ctmenvironmentcache.jl`):

* **`CTM_PINV_CUTOFF ≈ 1e-8 ≈ √eps`, not 1e-12.** The inverse powers of `S` amplify roundoff,
  and `S` comes from an eig of a squared object so it is only resolved to ~√eps relatively. A
  null-space-only cutoff leaves a hard, χ-independent error floor (measured: 9.5e-7).
* **Krylov needs an isometry guard.** `eigsolve` returns non-orthonormal vectors on degenerate
  clusters, silently corrupting the projector (err 3.9 vs 0.027). Check `‖V'V − I‖` and fall
  back to dense.
* **One-sided truncation is not a valid variational choice** and makes the error non-monotonic
  in χ. This was the root cause of a long chain of confusing results.

### Two-sided projectors inside the per-vertex DP

Each interface is bounded by exactly two corners, which are its two half-environments:

| interface | west/north half | east/south half |
|---|---|---|
| `PH[:N,x,y]` | `C_NW(x+1,y)` | `C_NE(x+1,y)` |
| `PH[:S,x,y]` | `C_SW(x+1,y)` | `C_SE(x+1,y)` |
| `PV[:W,x,y]` | `C_NW(x,y+1)` | `C_SW(x,y+1)` |
| `PV[:E,x,y]` | `C_NE(x,y+1)` | `C_SE(x,y+1)` |

So `ρ_L`, `ρ_R` for the biorthogonal pair come from those two corners, and the pair is applied
by **side**: `P_A` to everything touching the interface from the west/north
(`C_NW(x+1,y).right`, `T_N(x,y).right`), `P_B` to everything touching it from the east/south
(`C_NE(x+1,y).left`, `T_N(x+1,y).left`). Every contraction across the interface then pairs one
`P_A` with one `P_B`, for all three region types (in a plaquette the two corners meet directly;
in a vertex region the edge tensor sits between them).

Both enlarged corners expose the *same* interface index set, which is what makes the pair
well defined — e.g. for `PH[:N,x,y+1]`:

```
C̃_NW(x+1,y+1) = C_NW(x,y)·T_N(x,y)·T_W(x,y)·a(x,y)            → right ins = (PH[:N,x,y].w, hlink(x,y))
C̃_NE(x+1,y+1) = C_NE(x+2,y)·T_N(x+1,y)·T_E(x+2,y)·a(x+1,y)    → left  ins = (PH[:N,x,y].w, hlink(x,y))
```

**Important negative result:** the projector must be applied *at the moment of growth*, when the
interface is `χ·D`-dimensional. Re-truncating an already-projected interface index in place is a
**no-op** — its dimension is already ≤ χ, so the projector is the identity and the sweep changes
nothing. A cheap "refine the existing basis" iteration therefore does not work: each sweep must
**regrow** the corners from the previous state's blocks and project the fresh, enlarged
interfaces. That is why the iteration and the two-sided projector are one piece of work.

### Stationarity (the iteration)

A two-sided projector inside the per-vertex DP needs the complement environment, which needs
the other corners — genuinely circular. So it must be iterated (Jacobi): within a sweep,
**every** tensor is built from the *previous* sweep's state, and the new projectors are derived
from the enlarged corners. Mixing new corners with old edges produces index/basis mismatch
("not a valid combiner contraction"). Store the projector dicts in the state so the nested
interfaces can reference the previous level's indices. Iterate until `F` stops changing;
previously this converged in 2–3 sweeps.

This is what "make `Z_v` stationary" means operationally, and it lands *together with* the
two-sided projector rather than as a separate feature.

### Double layer, kept lazy

A vertex's factors stay a `Vector{ITensor}` from `bp_factors` (`[ket, bra]`, or
`[ket, op, bra]`); environments keep ket and bra legs separate at dimension D and are never
fused to D². Each absorption contracts the flat list `[env; factors…]` with
`contraction_sequence(...; alg="optimal")`. Note the measured lesson: this representation alone
buys ~1× — the win is in *not* forming the fat site tensor, while the dominant cost is the
merged per-column object. Absorbing one layer at a time is ~40× faster but far less accurate,
so it is not used.

## Validation plan (each step must pass before the next)

1. **Lossless limit**: at large χ every region type (vertex / h-edge / v-edge / plaquette)
   contracts to the exact `Z`. Test interior, edge *and* corner vertices — boundary regions are
   where index bookkeeping breaks.
2. **Möbius identity**: `V − E + P = 1`, so `F = ln Z` at large χ.
3. **Cancellation**: at moderate χ, per-region error ≫ error of the weighted sum.
4. **Monotonicity in χ** — non-monotonic error means the projector is wrong (this is the
   canary that caught the one-sided bug).
5. **Stationarity**: `F` converges under sweeps.
6. **Against boundary MPS** at matched χ and D, on a **random non-symmetric** network
   (a symmetric Ising model can be passed by accident via symmetry crutches).

Reference values: `contract(tn; alg="exact")`, `norm_sqr(ψ; alg="exact")`, and
`contract(tn; alg="boundarymps", mps_bond_dimension=χ)`.

## Status

| piece | state |
|---|---|
| two-sided eig projector + Arnoldi + cutoff discipline | done, committed, validated |
| lazy double-layer factors | done, committed |
| row-absorption contractor | done, committed — **wrong object**, keep only as a reference contractor |
| per-vertex C/T DP (grow + project) | **done** — `vertex_environments`, single-pass greedy, generic over `bp_factors` |
| region contraction + Möbius sum | **done** — `region_lnZ`, `cvm_freenergy` |
| stationary sweep with two-sided projectors | **to build** — needs regrowth per sweep (see above) |
| re-measure vs boundary MPS | greedy pass measured; **redo after the sweep lands** |

### Measured with the single-pass (greedy, one-sided) DP

All regions contract to exact `Z` at large χ — interior, edge and corner vertices, boundary
edges, corner plaquettes (0 – 1.8e-15) — and the Möbius sum returns `ln Z` exactly, confirming
`V − E + P = 1`. The cancellation is real: random positive 4×4, D=3, χ=8 → single region
1.20e-4, CVM sum **8.67e-7** (~140×). Monotone in χ apart from a small bump at χ=4.

Against boundary MPS on the same network it currently **loses** (D=3 χ=8: 8.7e-7 vs 1.9e-10).
Expected for a one-sided greedy pass — in the row engine the two-sided projector was worth
4–13 orders of magnitude. That is the next thing to build, and the comparison should be redone
only after it lands.
