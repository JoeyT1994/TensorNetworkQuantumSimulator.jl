#   * centre  = a NO-MODE virtual hub  (honeycomb vertex / Kagome triangle)
#   * leaf    = a Kagome site          (honeycomb edge), one fermion mode + the
#               virtual bonds to the (one or two) triangle centres it belongs to.
#
# These live OUTSIDE the library on purpose (the library's gate factory only builds
# 1- and 2-site fermionic gates). `include` this file at the top of a driver script.
# The primitives below are exactly the ones validated against ED in the graded
# single-triangle and bowtie prototypes (/tmp/tnqs_graded_triangle.jl,
# /tmp/tnqs_graded_bowtie.jl): clean O(dt^2) inter-triangle Trotter scaling,
# Richardson -> ED to ~1e-9, and lossless (machine-eps) graded star re-splits.
#
# The one fermionic subtlety, handled in `apply_cluster_gate`: a 3-site gate is an
# even operator with its sites ADJACENT in a fixed mode order, so it must be applied
# by first bringing the cluster's three site legs adjacent via a fermionic `permute`
# (which threads the Jordan-Wigner sign through each leaf's EXTERNAL bond to the other
# triangle) and THEN contracting ordinarily. A fermionic `contract` of gate-onto-blob,
# or an ordinary contract without the permute, corrupts the odd-odd (hopping) channel.

    triangle_fock_matrix(w_ab, w_bc, w_ca; μ = 0.0) -> 8x8 ComplexF64

Jordan-Wigner Fock matrix (mode order a<b<c) of the 3-mode hopping Hamiltonian
`H = w_ab c†_a c_b + w_bc c†_b c_c + w_ca c†_c c_a + h.c.` along the directed bonds
a->b->c->a. Pass the (generally complex) Peierls amplitude *along each arrow*; the
h.c. partner supplies the reverse bond, so `H` is Hermitian for any complex `w`s.
For the chiral Kagome an up- or down-triangle has all three along-arrow amplitudes
equal to `t·(t1 - i·λ1) = t·e^{-iϕ}` (Tang et al., arXiv:1111.1172).

`μ` adds an on-site chemical potential `-μ(n_a + n_b + n_c)` to `H`. Because every Kagome
site sits in exactly one up-triangle, folding `-μ N` into the up-triangle gates (and only
those) realises the grand-canonical generator `H_hop - μN` with no double counting; with `μ`
inside the single-particle gap this pins the imaginary-time evolution at the target filling
(the tensors track only parity, so truncation would otherwise leak particle number).

"""
    star_resplit(blob, sites, exts; cutoff = 0.0, maxdim = nothing) -> (leaves::Vector, centre, Ss::Vector)

Graded STAR re-split of a post-gate cluster `blob` back into `length(sites)` leaf tensors plus a
no-mode centre hub. `sites[k]` is leaf k's physical index; `exts[k]` lists the external legs leaf
k must keep (from [`external_legs`](@ref)). Each leaf is peeled with a fermionic **symmetric**
`svd` on `[sites[k]; exts[k]...]`: `blob ≈ (U√S) ∘ (√S V)`, so the leaf `X = U√S` and the running
remainder `Y = √S V` each carry √S on their shared bond — the Vidal/BP-symmetric gauge, in which
the bond's belief-propagation message is exactly the singular-value matrix `S`. The final
remainder is the centre (carrying the new leaf bonds). `cutoff`/`maxdim` are forwarded to the
fermionic `symmetric_svd` (both parity sectors share one truncation); with `cutoff = 0.0,
maxdim = nothing` the re-split is lossless. Works for any leaf count (e.g. a 2-leaf boundary
cluster, not just a 3-leaf triangle).

Returns `(leaves, centre, Ss)` where `Ss[k]` is the diagonal bond spectrum (a 2-leg
`FermionicITensor` on `[b_k, prime(b_k)]`, `b_k = commonind(leaves[k], centre)`) of leaf k's bond
to the centre. The caller installs `Ss[k]` as the BP message on that bond so the cache stays
consistent when the bond index/dimension changes under truncation (cf. `apply_gate!`).

"""
    cluster_update_triangle(centre, leaves, sites, gate; cutoff = 0.0, maxdim = nothing, envs = nothing) -> (newleaves, newcentre, Ss)

One exact cluster update: gather `centre * leaves`, apply the exact `gate` on `sites`,
normalise, and graded-star-re-split — keeping each leaf's external bond to its OTHER cluster.
`leaves[k]` carries physical index `sites[k]`. The external legs are detected automatically
via [`external_legs`](@ref). `cutoff`/`maxdim` are forwarded to the re-split SVDs.

`envs` (default `nothing`) is the cluster's incoming BP messages — e.g.
`incoming_messages(ψ_bpc, [centre_vert; leaf_verts...])`, one 2-leg `FermionicITensor` per
external bond. When supplied, each external leg is GAUGED by the matrix square root of its
incoming message before the gate is applied and UN-GAUGED (by `dag` of the inverse root)
afterwards — exactly the Vidal-gauge round-trip `simple_update` uses, generalised to a
multi-leaf star. The round-trip `X·dag(X⁻¹) = I` is lossless, so with no truncation the
result is identical to the bare update; with truncation the re-split SVDs now act in the
BP/Vidal gauge and the truncation is (approximately) variational rather than bare-norm. An
external leg with no matching message (a dangling boundary leg) is left ungauged.

Works for any leaf count: a 3-leaf triangle (`gate = triangle_gate`) or a 2-leaf boundary
cluster (`gate = fermionic_hopping_gate`). Returns `(newleaves, newcentre, Ss)`; `Ss[k]` is the
bond spectrum of leaf k's bond to the centre (see [`star_resplit`](@ref)). The caller writes the
tensors back into the network AND installs each `Ss[k]` as the BP message on that bond — without
that, a bond whose index/dimension changed under truncation leaves a stale message in the cache
and the next `update` reads it on the wrong (old) bond, corrupting BP.
